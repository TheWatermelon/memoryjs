# What is it?
Memoryjs is a tribute to my first graphical game made originally in C. It is based on the html5 canvas and written in pure Javascript.

# TODO
- **menus**
	- [ ] main menu (click/any key to play + waldo image)
	- [ ] in between levels (next level, quit to main menu)
- [X] data structure with all cards
- [ ] game borders (candy ?)
- **game engine**
	- [X] flip card
	- [X] match two cards (= pair)
	- [X] increasing difficulty with each level (include 1 more column per level)
	- [X] generate random pairs in custom structure
	- [X] draw cards on screen
	- [X] clicks count
	- [X] timer
